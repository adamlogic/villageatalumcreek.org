Happy New Year!

Our 2014 Neighborhood Directory is now published, thanks for your patience.

Given the increase in folks moving in and out and constantly changing cell
numbers, dropping home phones, and using different email addresses, in the
future, we may just do some sort of on line directory that you can print at
home.

Our special thanks to our past president JD Barlow who put together the
directory information and layout.  We also want to say thanks to our
advertisers whose payments paid for the printing.

The directory was mailed with your 2014 dues invoice in the 3rd week in
January.  If you havenâ€™t received a copy by February 10th, please let us know.

If you see an error or need to update your listing, please let us know at
directory@villageatalumcreek.org

We will have a small supply of extra directories for new residents.  Have a
prosperous new year!
