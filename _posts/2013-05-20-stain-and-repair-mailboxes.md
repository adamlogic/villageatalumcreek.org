title: Stain and Repair Mailboxes
author: JD
---

Thanks to all homeowners that have updated and repaired mailboxes to the our
neighborhood standard.  Based on our last survey of homeowners, this was one
of the top areas of concern in the neighborhood and prompted an action taken
by the HOA.

Many homeowners have extra stain if needed, just ask around.  If you need more
parts or a replacement contact Cedar Craft.  We also believe Roush Hardware in
Westerville carries the Cedar Craft products.

The mailbox stain is Behr Cedar DP391 Base #30, and it is available from Home
Depot (See VAC [Mailbox Policy][7]).  This is a slightly different stain than
what has been used in the past, but due to complaints about the previous stain
we opted to move to a brand that is more readily available, cheaper in cost,
and better in coverage of the wood (while also similar in color to the
previous stain).

services to help out:
