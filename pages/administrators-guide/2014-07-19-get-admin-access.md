## Set up your GitHub account

Since our site is hosted with GitHub Pages, your first step is to create a free GitHub account. Go to [github.com](http://github.com), and choose a username and password for your account.

On the next screen, you'll be asked to choose your plan. The "free" plan is chosen by default, so just click "finish sign up".

Okay, you have your GitHub account. Now you need to be added as a "collaborator" on our project (this website). For that you'll need to contact one of the current collaborators and have them add you. Be sure to tell them the username you chose when signing up.

If you're a collaborator and need to add someone, go to our [Website Contributors page](https://github.com/orgs/vachoa/teams/website-contributors) on GitHub, and enter the username provided.

## Log into Prose

Now that your GitHub account is set up, you'll log into Prose, which we use to actually edit the content of our website. Go to [prose.io](http://prose.io/) and click the "authorize on GitHub" button. You'll be momentarily taken back to GitHub where you'll need to click "authorize application" and enter your password to confirm.

Now that you're "logged in" on Prose, use [this link](http://prose.io/#vachoa/villageatalumcreek.org) to go directly to the VAC website content, and you're [ready to explore]().
