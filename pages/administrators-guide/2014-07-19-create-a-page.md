title: Create a Page

Starting at our site's [administration console](http://prose.io/#vachoa/villageatalumcreek.org), navigate to where you want to create a new page. Most of our pages reside in sections, so go to that section and click "new file".

Once you've added your title and removed the default content, you're ready to start writing! You'll notice that when you add headings, links, or other formatting, funky notations are added to your content. That's because you're writing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Markdown is just a way of notating text formatting in simple plain text. While it will feel foreign at first, this is actually a safeguard to prevent unexpected formatting issues.

When you're done writing, click the "save" button, then "commit".

That's it! You've created a page, and it should be live on the site within seconds.

Creating a blog post almost identical, except the you create it within the "posts" folder, and you should specify an author. To specify the author, you use the "metadata" icon on the right side.
