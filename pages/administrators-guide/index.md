If you already have admin access and you just want to dive in, [visit our Prose console here](http://prose.io/#vachoa/villageatalumcreek.org). If you see a little green button in the bottom right, click that to authorize with GitHub.

This site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and all of the content management is done through [Prose](http://prose.io). This guide is intended to walk you through how to use Prose to create and edit the site's content.

The guide is divided into the following sections:

- [Get admin access](/pages/administrators-guide/2014-07-19-get-admin-access.html) – This page explains the process of getting admin access and logging into Prose.
- [Site organization](/pages/administrators-guide/2014-07-19-site-organization.html) – Before creating and editing the site content, it helps to understand how it is organized in Prose, and especially the difference between "pages" and "blog posts".
- [Create a page](/pages/administrators-guide/2014-07-19-create-a-page.html) – Learn how to create a new page or blog post.
- [Edit the sidebar links](/pages/administrators-guide/2014-07-19-add-a-sidebar-link.html) – Manage our (massive) list of links in the blog sidebar.

Our mailing list is separate from the site, and is managed by MailChimp. See the [MailChimp instructions here].
