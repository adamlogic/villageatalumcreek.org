If you already have admin access and you just want to dive in, [visit our Prose console here](http://prose.io/#vachoa/villageatalumcreek.org). If you see a little green button in the bottom right, click that to authorize with GitHub.

This site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and all of the content management is done through [Prose](http://prose.io). This guide is intended to walk you through how to use Prose to create and edit the site's content.

The guide is divided into the following sections:

- [Get admin access](/administrators-guide/get-admin-access.html) – This page explains the process of getting admin access and logging into Prose.
- [Site organization](/administrators-guide/site-organization.html) – Before creating and editing the site content, it helps to understand how it is organized in Prose, and especially the difference between "pages" and "blog posts".
- [Create a page](/administrators-guide/create-a-page.html) – Learn how to create a new page.
- [Edit a page](/administrators-guide/edit-a-page.html) – Learn how to edit a page that already exists on the site.
- [Create a blog post](/administrators-guide/create-a-blog-post.html) – Learn how to post to our blog.
- [Edit the sidebar links](/administrators-guide/edit-sidebar-links.html) – Manage our (massive) list of links in the blog sidebar.
- [How it all works](/administrators-guide/how-it-works.html) – This gets a bit technical, but check it out if you'd like to know how this site is built and all the pieces that make it happen.
