title: Using the Mailing List
---

Our mailing list is managed by MailChimp. MailChimp has a *lot* of features, and our needs are simple. Try not to get overwhelmed by everything available, as you'll only need to use a fraction of what's there.

## Sending an email (aka "Campaign")

MailChimp calls each email you send to the list a "Campaign". When you create a Campaign, you have to choose a design Template. I've created a very basic template that you can use called "Based VAC Announcement". The animation below walks through the process. Remember to clear out the placeholder text when creating a new campaign.
