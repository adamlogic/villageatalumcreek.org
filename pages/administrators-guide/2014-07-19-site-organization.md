Looking at our site's [administration console on Prose](http://prose.io/#vachoa/villageatalumcreek.org), you'll see four folders:

- **includes** is where our we manage the links along our sidebar..
- **posts** is where our blog posts live. Blog posts are what you see on our home page listed newest to oldest. Blog posts are typically used for news, announcements, and other topics where "newness" matters.
- **pages** is where our static pages live. Pages exist on their own with no notion of time or "newness". Most of our content lives in these pages since most of our HOA information is static â€“ it doesn't really change over time.
- **uploads** is where all of our uploaded documents and photos live. It's a mess in there, but that's okay. It's really just a place for us to stick these things so we can link to them from other pages.

Feel free to click around and explore. You can't really break anything (unless you click a trash can icon, but even those will prompt for confirmation before deleting anything). One thing to keep in mind with our site is that we have a versioned history of *everything*. Any change can be undone, any page can be recovered. So try not to stress. ;-)
