**Bunco Players Needed**  
The VAC ladiesâ€™ bunco group is looking for 2 more players. We can use either 2
full time players, 4 ladies who would rather play every other month, or a
combination of the two. We play every 3rd Thursday of the month, eat and have
a lot of fun! If you are interested, please call or email Nancy Moore
(548-7621) [nmoore23@yahoo.com][1]. Thanks!

To have your own ad posted on the website, please [contact the
association][2].
