**St. Andrews Church Event:  Saturday Oct 22, 2011**

The day begins with a Rummage Sale from 9-12. From 12-5 we will have games, a
bake sale, grilled hot dogs, pumpkin patch, face painting, balloons, clowns,
our own Contemporary band, and the Fire Dept. It is going to be a fun day,
full of things to do.

Admission is free. Games are free and prizes will be awarded to the kids.
Proceeds from the Rummage sale, bake sale and hot dog meal benefit the church
and its mission. We are also holding a raffle for an IPAD2. Only 250 tickets
will be sold. If anyone is interested in purchasing a ticket they can call me
at 740-803-7000. Tickets are $5 each or a book of 5 for $20.

We welcome anyone and everyone to attend this event. We also are accepting
donations for the Rummage sale if anyone has items they wish to donate. Drop
off dates are listed on the website or we may be able to arrange for a pickup
by calling me.
